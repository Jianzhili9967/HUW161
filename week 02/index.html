<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h3>H1 | Merienda-Bold | 36px</h3>
<br>

<h2>This is my font selection. I chose Merienda-Bold for the main headings and some titles because it has soft shapes and is slightly condensed, can make reader fell comfortable and create a sense of  friendly. Karla is a quirky sans-serif typeface, but it's popular,  so I think it can attract reader to read important and breif information.</h2>
<h3>H2 | Merienda-Bold | 14px</h3>
<br>

<p>Karla is a grotesque sans serif typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and the Tamil script. This is the Latin script part of the family, with Roman and Italic styles in two weights, Regular and Bold.</p>
<h3>P | Karla-Bold | 14px</h3>
